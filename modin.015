This file shows what your screen would look like if you invoked ZAMS
and gave it some input for a 15 solar mass model with uniform
composition X=0.74 and Y=0.24. Input is in lower case as answers to
questions that ZAMS asks. Remarks made between /* and */ are comments
by us to guide you.

_______________________________________________________________

THE TOTAL MASS IS (IN MSUN)
15.        /* Enter mass in solar units. */
X(Hydrogen) AND Y(HELIUM) ARE
.74 .24   /* Enter Hydrogen and helium mass fractions for model. */
GUESS FOR CENTRAL PRESSURE (IN CGS)
2.77e16  /* Enter guess for central pressure in cgs units. */
GUESS FOR CENTRAL TEMPERATURE (IN K)
3.28e7   /* Enter guess for central temperature in Kelvin. */
GUESS FOR TOTAL RADIUS (IN CM)
3.29e11   /* Enter guess for stellar radius in cm. */
GUESS FOR TOTAL LUMINOSITY (IN LSUN)
1.95e4       /* Enter guess for surface luminosity in units of solar
			luminosity. */
WHAT IS YOUR OUTPUT FILENAME?
modout.015  /* Enter the name of the file you want output to be
		directed to. This file is also on this diskette
		as output to the above input and guesses and
		contains the final model quantities. */
DO YOU WANT PULSATION OUTPUT? (Y/N)
n  /* If you answer y or Y to this question then additional
	output will be written to the file given below. That
	output is used in PULS.FOR. If the answer is n or N
	then no additional output will be written. Only one
        model is computed per run. You must re-invoke ZAMS to
        compute another model.*/
